# Employee Payroll Management System
## Note: This is just a demo version of a more complicated and robust payroll management system.
### Introduction
A payroll management system is a software tool designed to automate and streamline the process of paying employees. It helps businesses calculate employee salaries, taxes, deductions, and benefits, manage employee time and attendance, generate payslips, and file tax forms, among other things.

### What does it do?
1. Add details of an employee
2. Delete the details of the employee when he/she leaves the company
3. Display all the employee list

## Disclaimer
I have not used any form of database here :disappointed: as it only focuses on understanding different OOPs concepts and how they are used in real world applications.I will connect a database to it soon...:sweat_smile: . If anyone wants to improve this system then you are welcome to do so and also a heartful thanks for your contribution in advance :smile: .

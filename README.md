# Employee Payroll Management System
## Note: This is just a demo version of a more complicated and robust payroll management system.
### Introduction
A payroll management system is a software tool designed to automate and streamline the process of paying employees. It helps businesses calculate employee salaries, taxes, deductions, and benefits, manage employee time and attendance, generate payslips, and file tax forms, among other things.

### What does it do?
1. Add details of an employee
2. Delete the details of the employee when he/she leaves the company
3. Display all the employee list

### How to connect to Postgresql db using jdbc?
Step 1: Download the postgressql jdbc driver (.jar file) from the link https://jdbc.postgresql.org/
Step 2: Go to Project Structures and then to Libraries
Step 3: Select the .jar file you just downloaded and then run the connectDb method in PayrollSystem class

## NOTE
Use your own databse url,username and password to store the data. Initialize your own value of the url,username and password in the PayrollSystem.java file.

## Disclaimer
Need to work on the Update feature and make some more changes to make it better :sweat_smile: Will do it within a few days . If anyone wants to improve this system then you are welcome to do so and also a heartful thanks for your contribution in advance :smile: .
